        <p class="lead mb-5">I’m a graduate student pursuing a Master of Science in Business Analytics (Data Science Major) at the University of Illinois at Chicago with 2.5 years of work experience as a Software Engineer at Accenture. I have a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. <br/>
<br/>						
Over the years I have developed a strong background in the field of Machine learning/Advanced Statistics. I have a knack for analyzing large data and derive meaningful insights from it. I have gained sufficient hands-on experience in incorporating Statistical analysis/Predictive modeling to uncover hidden truths about the data. I have acquired a strong expertise in analytics tools like R, SQL, SPSS, Spark. In addition to it, I have a profound knowledge of computer programming languages that include Python, Java, C, C++, MATLAB. Also, I’ve mastered the art of visually analyzing chunks of data with the help of Tableau.</br>
<br/>
Over recent years, I’ve worked on multiple Data science and analytics projects comprising of data from various domains like healthcare, marketing, finance, etc. Recently, I delved into the field of Deep Learning and Natural Language processing where I got an opportunity to work on a summer research project on deep learning algorithms for natural language processing.
